# Boggle

## Description

This is my A Level Computer Science Project

It is a digital version of the board game 'Boggle' created with python and using a graphical user interface.

## Instructions

'Boggle.py' is the main program here, so run this with python to play the game in the GUI.

## Libraries

I have made use of the 'pygame_functions' library, which is a set of functions to make using pygame easier, and was created by Steve Paget:
