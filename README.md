# Boggle

## Description

This is my A Level Computer Science Project

It is a digital version of the board game 'Boggle' created with python and using a graphical user interface.

## Instructions

'Boggle.py' is the main program here, so run this with python to play the game in the GUI.

### Here's how the game works:

You will be shown a 4x4 grid of letters.
You must make as many words as you can within the time limit.
The longer the word, the more points it scores.

Words can only be made according to the following rules:
1. The letters must be adjoined in a ‘chain’ (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).
2. Words must contain at least three letters.
3. No letter cube may be used more than once within a single word

## Libraries

I have made use of the 'pygame_functions' library, which is a set of functions to make using pygame easier, and was created by Steve Paget:
